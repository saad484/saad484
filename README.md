<!-- Introduction -->
As a software engineering student with a passion for coding and design, I'm always striving to expand my knowledge and expertise in the field. With mastery in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, I'm well-equipped to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

But I'm not just a coder - I also have a keen eye for design and user experience, with proficiency in Adobe tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and XD. Whether it's building sleek and intuitive user interfaces or optimizing backend functionality, I believe that great software starts with a focus on both form and function.

As I continue my education and embark on my career in software engineering, I'm excited to collaborate with others and contribute to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact. Let's connect and see how we can work together to bring great ideas to life!
